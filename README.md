Erin Thetires is looking at buying a newer, more fuel efficient car [e.g., a hybrid car]. She wants to know how much money she will save each year if she does this. In order to figure this out we need to write a program that takes in the number of miles driven per year, the MPG in her current car, the MPG of the new car, and the cost of gasoline. From this we can calculate the cost of running her current car and the cost of running the new car. Using THESE numbers we can calculate the savings per year if she buys the new car. Report the savings (or loss--a negative number) with the new/hybrid car.
